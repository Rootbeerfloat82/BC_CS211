 The new bus fare classes are far more efficient then the practice 1 example. 
 The first thing they address is the fact that in the og file only chole could 
 get the dicount senior rates and only ted could get the regular rates. The new
 program solves this by having users use either the adult or senior child classes 
 when creating a new person for busfares. Additionaly, the program opts to have
 the child classes override the getFare method from the parent class so that way 
 you don't have to have a bunch of logic in the main file to determine if the 
 person is a senior or adult as this is taken care of by the child classes.
 Lastly, by having a static variable for the busFare in the fare parent class, 
 one is able to easily change the standard busfare for all of the classes if
 rates go up or down.
