 This data structure - priority queue - would be extremely benefical in a hospital. This is because the queue uses an priority
 based system to decide who is at the top. In a hospital, you could assign every person that comes in with a number based on the 
 urgency of their condition. For instance, someone with a missing arm might be a 5 while someone with a cold could be a 75. Here,
 the lower number would represent that the most urgent instance. This way, doctors would know who needs to be taken care of next,
 and would have the best chances to make everyone ok. Another example could be the maintance for a website. As issues/bugs start 
 getting reported, they could be assigned a value, with lower numbers representing more urgent issues. For instance, a bug that 
 completely breaks the website could be a 3 while a bug that messes up the font on one of the pages might be a 63. In doing so, 
 the programers would know which bugs are the most important for them to target first, and which ones can go on the burner for a 
 bit while they work on more pressing issues.
